# Education Data

## Overview:
Using a simple data set of student assessment scores, this project aims to analyze student performance, to identify what factors may positively/negatively impact performance, as well as to use a clustering algorithm to group students based on their overall scores. This information could help educators to identify students that may need more targeted support in instruction, as well as identifying strategies to help students increase their performance.

## Methods:

This data set was analyzed using the following methods:
  - Initial inspection of data to determine dataset size and makeup.
  - Feature engineered a new column of a cumulative score by adding the three numeric scores together.
  - EDA to compare each feature with the target feature, identified as the total score.
  - After EDA was completed, a lustering algorithm was utilized to group students into 3 groups.

## Findings:

1. From EDA and comparison to the target feature, one thing that stood out was that students who completed a test preparation course consistently outscored their peers who did not when comparing average scores. This is important if the school is trying to improve test scores, as they can consider providing more test preparation for the students ahead of the assessment. 
2. From the clustering algorithm, students were grouped by total scores. There were three groups that identified students with low, medium, and high average scores. Using this information, the school can make better decisions regarding the types and frequencies of more targeted instruction that students may need in order to be more successful on these types of assessments. For example, low scoring students may need more targeted instruction in either reading, writing, or math (or all 3) in order to raise test scores. Students with medium scores may need more exposure to test preparation, and higher achieving students may be given more enrichment to keep scores high.

## Limitations and Next Steps:

This dataset is slightly limited in that it only contains a certain amount of demographic data, and a limited number of records. Having a larger dataset, both in terms of records and features, could lead to more in-depth analyses and better recommendations for the school.
